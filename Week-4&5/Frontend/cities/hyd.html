        <p>Hyderabad, the capital of Telangana in southern India, is a vibrant metropolis known as the "City of Pearls" and a major hub for technology and pharmaceuticals. Situated along the Musi River on the Deccan Plateau, this historic city was founded in 1591 by Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah and is renowned for its unique blend of Islamic heritage, rich culture, and modern infrastructure. It is celebrated as a UNESCO creative city of gastronomy, offering iconic dishes like Hyderabadi Biryani. 
The city boasts a rich architectural legacy, featuring landmarks such as the iconic Charminar, the massive Golconda Fort, and the exquisite palaces of the Nizams, including Chowmohalla and Falaknuma. While the Old City retains a traditional charm with bustling bazaars, modern Hyderabad, particularly around HITEC City, is a thriving center for IT, biotechnology, and business. Today, Hyderabad is recognized for its cosmopolitan atmosphere, friendly populace, and the coexistence of Hindu and Muslim traditions. </p>

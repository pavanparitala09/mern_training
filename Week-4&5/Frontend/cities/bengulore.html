    <p>Bengaluru, often called the Garden City and Silicon Valley of India, is a vibrant metropolis that acts as the
        bustling home to the passionate Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) IPL franchise. The city boasts a deep-rooted
        love for cricket, creating an electric atmosphere for the team's home matches. As the capital of Karnataka, it
        provides a dramatic, urban backdrop for the high-octane T20 action that defines the local sporting culture.
        The M. Chinnaswamy Stadium, situated in the heart of Bengaluru, is a premier cricketing venue with a 32,000-seat
        capacity. Established in 1969 and featuring modern technology like AI-enabled cameras, it is renowned for its
        high-scoring, compact pitch and energetic crowd. Despite hosting international, Test, and women's matches, it is
        best known as the iconic, often high-pressure home ground for RCB, having recently underwent upgrades following
        safety incidents.
        Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB), founded in 2008, is one of the most popular and followed teams in the Indian
        Premier League, with a massive, dedicated fan base known as the "red army". After years of being close
        contenders, RCB achieved a major milestone by winning their first IPL title in 2025. While they have faced
        challenges regarding the long-term use of the Chinnaswamy Stadium, the team remains a defining symbol of
        Bengaluru sports, led by figures like Virat Kohli in their quest for continued success. </p>

    <p>Chennai, formerly known as Madras, is the vibrant capital of Tamil Nadu and a major cultural, economic, and
        educational hub in South India. Located on the Coromandel Coast of the Bay of Bengal, it serves as the "Gateway
        to South India" and is recognized as the country's fourth-largest city. Known for its rich history dating back
        to 1639, Chennai successfully blends British-era architecture with deep-rooted Dravidian traditions, featuring
        landmarks like Fort St. George and numerous ancient temples.
        As a major industrial center, Chennai is often called the "Detroit of South Asia" for its massive automobile
        industry. It is also a key player in technology, healthcare, and manufacturing. The city is famous for its
        cultural scene, including classical Bharatanatyam dance, music, and the expansive Marina Beach. With a warm,
        humid climate and a population of over 6 million, it is a bustling, modern metropolis that still holds onto its,
        traditional, and welcoming character. </p>

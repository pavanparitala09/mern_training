                Kenneth and he had become such good friends. Kenneth forced Brock out of his comfort zone and made him
                try new things he'd never imagine doing otherwise. Up to this point, this had been a good thing. It had
                expanded Brock's experiences and given him a new appreciation for life. Now that both of them were in
                the back of a police car, all Brock could think was that he would have never dared do it except for the
                influence of Kenneth.
                The trees, therefore, must be such old and primitive techniques that they thought nothing of them,
                deeming them so inconsequential that even savages like us would know of them and not be suspicious. At
                that, they probably didn't have too much time after they detected us orbiting and intending to land. And
                if that were true, there could be only one place where their civilization was hidden.
                They argue. While the argument seems to be different the truth is it's always the same. Yes, the topic
                may be different or the circumstances, but when all said and done, it all came back to the same thing.
                They both knew it, but neither has the courage or strength to address the underlying issue. So they
                continue to argue.

                beautiful, but all she felt was fear. There had always been something about heights that disturbed her,
                and now she could feel the full force of this unease. She reluctantly crept a little closer with the
                encouragement of her friends as the fear continued to build. She couldn't help but feel that something
